Hi, and welcome to this video as we reach Vienna, because it's a good idea to clear down our environment.

And one optional thing you can do is delete the Forks repo from GitHub.

I'm going to keep mine up so you can use the code and check it for comparison because you want to do

that.

Let's have a look now once on GitHub.

Let's click on our simple Java Maven app.

And if we want to delete it, let's go to settings.

And if we scroll down all the way to the bottom, we have delete this repository, if you want to go

ahead and delete it, click on that and it's going to ask you to type in the repository name the way

around that is, you can copy paste pasted in and then click on this.

I understand consequences deletes this repository.

Again, it's optional.

It's up to you.

Next, what we're going to do is delete Jenkins.
