f you've been following along with a course, we set up a multipronged pipeline and we thought the

simple job and Maven app repo, what are we going to do is go inside Jenkins folder?

When she was Jenkins fall.

What I'm going to do is click on rule.

Copy everything.

Let's go back, back again and back again.

And inside here, I'm going to create a new foil.

I'm going to call it test Dalts Jenkins, vital piece in the contents.

And again, we're going to push this directly to a master branch so this may actually trigger a new

job.

But the key thing to note here is that we all going to have to jenkins' files.

But as far as Jenkins is concerned, it's still going to appoint sort of one inside the Jenkins folder.

We have to explicitly say which one to use.

And that's why we can have multiple Jenkins files inside, not committee.

This will say added new Jenkins file.

And let's submit the file.

Awesome.

And we can see it there.
