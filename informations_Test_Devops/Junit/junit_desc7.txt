In previous lessons, I showed you how to configure your unit in a Maven based project and in a grid

or base project as well.

In the following two lessons, I'll show you how to create a new unit test method in a basic Java project

that does not use a maven or gradle.

Now different developers use different development environments to write Java code and I will not be

able to use all of them in this course.

For this course I will mainly use intuitive development environment.

But just in case you're using another very popular development environment that is called Eclipse,

I'll show you how to create a new unit test in Eclipse IDE as well.

Unit Testing & Integration Testing of Java and Spring Boot applications.
