Hi and welcome back.

A concept I'm going to cover is Jenkins files with different names now for us, because we've been creating

folders to try and get around this by creating a file called Jenkins File.

Now, there is a bit of a downside to this, which I'm going to show you now if I get back over to voice

code.

We see we have this Jenkins file here.

Now, I can copy this, paste it and put the extension to one.

And sometimes what you might see is if it's environment specific, you might see something like base,

you might have Productos Jenkins file.

And now we can see it's created a new file.

Now, if we have a quick look at the difference between the two, we have Jenkins file like this.

It's colourful.

It looks nice.

And then we have this one perfectly valid.

It will still work.

However, as we can see, it's not as colorful and it looks a bit plain.

Unfortunately, at the time of writing this and even when I was a consultant, I can find a workaround

for this.

And my solution was really hacky.

So it would normally see was every different environment or maybe every different application should

have ap1 up to for Jenkins file.

Some engineers I knew would work on it like this.

And I don't know about you, but I'm so used to different colors getting used to to plug it in as well.

But the curly braces, I couldn't do it.

So all I used to do was rename the file and lock that out.

Well, let me do it here because I've already got a file called Jenkins File.

But that is how I would get around it.

So you can again see it all in color so you can go ahead and delete this, because what we'll do next

is I'll show you a demo and show you that this does work.

And as you can see here, this is colourful.

This is what we want.

And let's say back in our example, we change it.

And then once we're done, we'd go ahead and rename it sort of select product jenkins' file again.

And that will go ahead and work.

So next, let's have a demo of that working.
