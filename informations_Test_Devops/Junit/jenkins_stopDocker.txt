In our course, we've been using Docker to run Jenkins', not stop it.

If you have your terminal open, we can press control, see, and that will kill it, frankly.

And we can also run Docker container.

Alice.

And now we can see it's no longer running.

So one thing we have is a darker volume.

Now, optionally, you may want to delete this if you want to get rid of any trace of Jenkins, but

if you still want to keep your jobs we've used and what's considered expanding on your jenkins' knowledge

and keep what you've already created, then don't delete the volume.
